# AngularJwtAuthentication

This is a project based on the Udemy course 
[Angular Security Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/angular-security/)

I took inspiration from the course to create my own project, 
This project goes along with the nodejs Server: 
[Authentication server without Express](https://github.com/matteo9966/Authentication-Server-without-express)

To run the project:

- run command 
` "start:dev": "tsnd --respawn --debug --files server.ts --watch **/*.ts"`

this will initialize a https development server with self signed certificates,

- together with the server you must run the nodejs authentication server  [Authentication server without Express](https://github.com/matteo9966/Authentication-Server-without-express)
